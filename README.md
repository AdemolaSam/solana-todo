# üìù solana-todo

## Project Overview

This is a simple Todo app built with Next.js and integrated with the Solana wallet for authentication. Users can sign in using their wallet, create and manage todos, and securely access their data. The project demonstrates how to use wallet signature-based login and JWT authentication in a modern web app, combining Web3 and traditional backend practices.

It comprises of two parts, `client` - frontend where we use the following packages provided by Solana for wallet connection and authentication

- @solana/wallet-adapter-react
- @solana/wallet-adapter-base
- @solana/web3.js
- @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
- @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui
- @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css

The second part, `server` - backend. An express nodejs backend that sends message to frontend for signing, verifying the signature and authenticationg user using JsonWebToken (JWT) to maintain stateless authentication. It connects with a MongoDb database for file storing user details, todos, and retrieving them.

The backend used the following tools for verifying wallets and signed messages

- @solana/web3.js
- tweetnacl
- bs58
